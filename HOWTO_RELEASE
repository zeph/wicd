This is a quick-and-dirty reminder document on how to create a new release.
It might not be complete or perfect, but it's better than having nothing.

On http://launchpad.net/wicd
- create the milestone (see the series page, https://launchpad.net/wicd/1.7)
- assign bugs to the milestone
- move unfinished work to the *next* milestone (this is optional, I stopped doing this)

In the sources:
- ensure all work is committed
- bzr pull to make sure you have all work
- update the VERSION_NUM variable in setup.py
- sudo python setup.py compile_translations
- sudo python setup.py configure
- sudo python setup.py install
- test: sudo python wicd/wicd-daemon.py; python gtk/wicd-client.py # and check the versio number!
- update the NEWS file
- update the CHANGES file for Debian. Hint: bzr log -r717.. | head -n -1 > CHANGES && cat in/CHANGES.suffix >> CHANGES
- find -name "*.pyc" -o -name "*.orig" -o -name "*.rej" -o -name "*.~1~" -delete	# To clean stuff (Debian warns if this is not done)

Build the release tarball by running:
python setup.py sdist

On http://launchpad.net/wicd
- Attach the dist/wicd-*.tar.gz file to the milestone
- Release the milestone (by filling in its "released" date)
